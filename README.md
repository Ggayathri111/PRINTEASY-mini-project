## 🛑 **The Problem**

Have you ever visited a printing shop to get a printout or photocopy of your documents?  
You're usually asked to:

- Carry a **pen drive** or **USB cable**
- Or **share your phone number or email**

But what if your documents are **confidential**?

### 📂 **Examples of sensitive documents that should not be shared:**
- 🆔 **Aadhaar Cards**  
- 💳 **PAN Cards**  
- 📝 **Insurance Papers**  
- 📄 **Bank Statements**  
- 🔐 **Legal or Academic Records**  

### ⚠️ **The risks:**
1. Once shared, your files may stay on the shop's computer.
2. Sharing via WhatsApp or email exposes your **personal number** and **private data**.
3. This leads to a **serious risk of data breaches**.
